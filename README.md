# Java-Threading
Threading in java using time function
Threading is about executing function parallely or simultaneously using time function in java 
thread is inbuilt class in java with some methods run() etc......
we need to use inheritance to derive another class from thread class to use threading in java
we to create a object for that class which is derived from thread class
here the prints the values of number square and cube of number even they are in different functions they executed by thread
here we used Thread.sleep function to stop some function untill another function executes
